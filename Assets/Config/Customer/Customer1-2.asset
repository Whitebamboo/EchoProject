  request: "Hey! I\u2019d like a sweater today, but I\u2019m allergic to wool. Synthetic
    materials usually work better for me, but I\u2019m hoping there\u2019s an option
    made with some eco-friendly materials as well. Do you have anything like that?"

    matchResponse: "This sweater made with recycled polyester and organic cotton
      is great! Recycled polyester is better than normal polyester, and I don\u2019t
      need to worry about any wool. Thank you for finding it for me!"

      Can you look for something else?"
