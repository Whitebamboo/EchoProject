  request: "Hi, I\u2019m looking for a short sleeve t-shirt that I can wear for exercising.
    Something durable and stretchy would be nice\u2026 But I would still like it
    to include some eco-friendly materials. Do you guys have anything?"

    matchResponse: "This solid colored shirt made with recycled polyester and spandex
      will be great for exercising! And even after being worn for so many years it\u2019s
      still in great shape, so its durability holds up. Thanks so much!"

    matchResponse: "This shirt is great but\u2026 do you have any options that blend
      spandex with more eco-friendly materials? And maybe something solid instead
      of multicolor so it\u2019s easier to sort later."

      similar to this blend but that is short-sleeved?

  notMatchResponse: "I was hoping for something stretchy to exercise in\u2026 this
    material is natural which is great, but it can\u2019t stretch very well like
    spandex can. Can you look for something else that\u2019s blended with spandex?"
